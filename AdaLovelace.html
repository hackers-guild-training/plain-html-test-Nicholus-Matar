            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                From 1832, when she was seventeen, <b><q>her mathematical abilities </q></b>  to emerge,<span title="Turney 1972, p. 138."><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#cite_note-FOOTNOTETurney1972138-26"><sup>[26]</sup> </span></a>  and
                her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life. <sup>[43] </sup>
                Her mother's obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ada was taught mathematics from an early age.
                She was privately educated in mathematics and science by William Frend, William King,[a] and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Somerville"> <span title="
                    Mary Somer was a Scottish scientist, writer, and polymath. She studied mathematics and astronomy, and was nominated to be jointly the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society at the same time as Caroline Herschel.
                    ">Mary Somerville</a></span> , the
                 noted <b><q>19th-century</q></b> researcher and scientific author. In the 1840s, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan extended her "much help in
                 her mathematical studies" including study of advanced calculus topics including the "numbers of Bernoulli" (that formed her celebrated algorithm for Babbage's Analytical Engine).[44] In a letter to Lady Byron, De Morgan suggested that Ada's skill
                  in mathematics might lead her to become "an original mathematical investigator, perhaps of first-rate eminence."<sup>[45]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Lovelace often questioned basic assumptions through integrating
                poetry and science. Whilst studying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus"> <span title="In mathematics, differential calculus is a subfield of
                     calculus that studies the rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus,
                     the other being integral calculus—the study of the area beneath a curve.
                    ">differential calculus</span> </a>, she wrote to De Morgan:</p>
            <blockquote><p>I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can
                undergo, the unsuspected and to a beginner apparently impossible
                identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight, is I think
                one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies.
                I am often reminded of certain sprites and fairies one reads of, who are
                at one's elbows in one shape now, and the next minute in a form most dissimilar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#cite_note-FOOTNOTEToole199891%E2%80%93100-48"> <span title="Toole 1998, p. 99."><sup>[46]</sup></a></span> </p></blockquote>
                <p>Lovelace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively
                    applying mathematical and scientific concepts. She valued <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics"> <span title="Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the
                    relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality. The word "metaphysics" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean "after or behind or among [the study of] the natural". It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century CE editor
                     who assembled various small selections of Aristotle’s works into the treatise we now know by the name Metaphysics.
                    ">metaphysics</a></span> as much as mathematics,
                    viewing both as tools for exploring "the unseen worlds around us."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#cite_note-FOOTNOTEToole199891%E2%80%93100-48"> <span title="Toole 1998, p. 99."><sup>[47]</sup></a></span></p>
